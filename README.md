This example showcases a subtle error in Python's exception handling.  The `function_with_uncommon_error` function handles `ZeroDivisionError`, but if the inputs are of incorrect types (e.g., strings instead of numbers), a `TypeError` will occur *outside* the `try` block, and the function will simply return without an explicit error message.  This is an example of an incomplete exception-handling strategy.  The solution demonstrates how to catch this exception, or even better, validate input types in advance.
